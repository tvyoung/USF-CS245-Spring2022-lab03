CS 245-03 Lab03 Sorting

- arrayGenerator() function will generate an array that contains integers between 0 and 100
- algoName1Sort() function = insertion sort
- algoName2Sort() function = merge sort
- testing has been done with input of array sizes 1000, 10000, 100000, and 1000000 have been tested with iterations = 4 or 10
- each test iteration of array size 1000000 for insertion sort takes about 2-3 minutes
- package lab03 line has been commented out in lab files since it was causing errors when i tried to run my code
